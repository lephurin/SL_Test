    <h1>Mutable and Immutable objects</h1>
    <p>-Immutable object can't change value but mutable object can change-</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Example of Immutable objects in Javascript are "String and Number"</li>
        <li>Pros. Immutable object will not change I think when developing something else we don't need to worry about immutable object will change,<br>Cons. When you want to change a property of the object, you need to create a new one</li>
        <li>Really, I didn't know immutable object.This is first time I know about immutable object.Now I know keyword"const" value can change by push().So I think immutable will be another way to save determinedly values.</li>
